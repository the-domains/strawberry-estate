# Be Attentive

Create inspection reports and detail the condition of the property. Images can be attached to the assessment to illustrate what has been stated.

When the inspection is completed the tenant can review the inspection and provide feedback.

With Property Manager all inspection reports are kept providing a detailed report on how the tenant has looked after the establishment.
